1. What corrections did you have to make?

Adding image descriptions and Aria Labels.

1. Do you think your website is usable if you turn off the CSS? Why or why not?

No! It becomes a jumbled mess that is not WAVE approved. 

1. Is your site is tabbable? In other words, without the use of the mouse, are all the links and buttons accessible using the tab key?

Yes!



Reminder: don't forget to include a screenshot of your Wave report and link to it from your homepage!
