            1. What corrections did you have to make?  <br  /> <br />

Adding image descriptions and Aria Labels. <br  /> <br />

2. Do you think your website is usable if you turn off the CSS? Why or why not? <br /><br />

No! It becomes a jumbled mess that is not WAVE approved.  <br /><br />

3. Is your site is tabbable? In other words, without the use of the mouse, are all the links and buttons accessible using the tab key?
<br /><br/>
Yes!
